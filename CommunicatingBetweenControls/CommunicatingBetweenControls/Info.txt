Mediator Pattern:
  - Its used to create a loosly coupled system.
  - We define a class (component) here which have event and OnEvent(objsendr, eventargs) method.
    A component who wants to inform other componet with input (EventArgs) will call OnEvent(..) method
    and pass the input, Other component subscribe the event and use the input thrown by main component.


Jobs: Dropdown changes here pass the job object to OnEvent(..) method
  EmployeesOnJob: Subscribe the event and use the input
  JobDetails: Subscribe the event and use the input
